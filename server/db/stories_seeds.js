      welcome: "Welcome to my story of Ragnarok , The doom of the gods, and the end of the World!",

      page1:  "It begins with three winters of wars in Miogaro. Then Fimbulvetr follows, the winter of winters, with bitter frosts and biting winds. Three such winters will follow with no summer between them.Then the end will begin. The wolf Skoll will seize the sun and swallow her, spattering Asgaro with gore. The wolf Hati will catch the moon and mangle him. The stars will vanish. The earth will shake. Every bond and fetter will burst.Cocks will crow to raise the dead in Hel's realm and the giants in Jotenheim. Jormangandr will work his way towards dry land. The ship Naglfar, made from dead men's nails, will sail, packed with giants. Loki, free from his bonds, will sail with the dead from Hel. The sons of Muspell will advance from the south, led by Surtr, the flame giant. All will converge on the field Vigrio: giants and the dead from Hel and Fenrir and Jormangandr and Surtr and the blazing sons of Muspell. Meanwhile, the gods, roused by Heimdall's horn, will meet in council. Odin will ride Sleipnir to Mímir's spring to take advice from Mimir. Yggdrasil will shake and moan. All of the Aesir and all of the Einherjar in Valholl will arm and prepare themselves and follow Ooin to Vigrio.",

      page2: "On the field of battle, Odin will engage Fenrir, while por will be attacked by Jormangandr. Freyr will fight Surtr. Freyr will rue the day he gave his sword to Skirnir; Surtr will kill Freyr with a single stroke. The hound Garm from Gnipahellir will leap at the throat of Tyr, and they will kill each other. Loki and Heimdall will meet again and cause each other's death. Por will kill Jormangandr with a single stroke from Mjollnir, but will drown in the venom spewed by the serpent. Fenrir will seize Ooin between his jaws and swallow him. At once, Vioar, Odin's son, will press one foot on Fenrir's lower jaw and grab his upper jaw, tearing the wolf apart and avenging his father. Surtr will fling fire in all directions. Asgaro and Miogaro and Jotenheim and Niflheim will become furnaces. The worlds will burn and the gods will die. Men, women, and children will die, giants will die, monsters will die. Birds and animals will die. The earth will sink into the sea.The earth will rise again out of the water, fair and green. The eagle will fly and catch fish under crags.",

      page3: "Grain will ripen in fields that were never sewn.Vioar and Vali, sons of Odin, will still be alive and will make their way back to Ioavoll, the shining plain where the halls of the gods once stood. Mooi and Magni, sons of Por, will join them there, and they will inherent their father's hammer, Mjollnir. Baldr and Hoor will come back from the world of the dead to Ioavoll, along with Hoenir. They will talk and will build new halls.Two humans, Líf and Liforasir, who hid themselves deep within Yggdrasil, will see light. For although the sun was eaten by Skoll, she will give birth to a daughter no less fair, who will follow the same sky-path and light the world. Lif and Lífoasir will have children; there will be new life everywhere on earth.With the rebirth of the world after Ragnarök, the golden age of the Norse gods will return. A radiant hall will rise up which no flames of perdition can touch. In that hall, the noble warriors who fought along side the gods will live on in joy. The ignoble will be carried away by a dragon to be eaten. The gods will find the golden playing pieces of their board game in the shining meadow, and they will build on the triumphant foundations laid down by Odin."

    bloodEagle:
    {
      welcome: "Welcome to my story all about the gruesome blood eagle. This was an execution method used for the mosted hated enemies of the Viking and is usually saved for Royalty.",

      page1: "The blood eagle is a ritualized method of execution. There have been two notable instances of this being carried out, where the victims were both members of royal families, the more famous being, the execution of King Aelle of Northumbria. Both victims were placed in a prone position, their ribs severed from the spine with a sharp tool, and their lungs pulled through the opening and draped over the shoulders to resemble a pair of folded wings.",

      page2: "Here is a short, dramatic, reinactment of the blood eagle from the History Channels show, Vikings",

      page3: "There is continuing debate about whether the ritual was a literary invention, a mistranslation of the original texts, or an authentic historical practice, however as we have uncovered the writings of Ivar the Boneless, it is safe to say these reports are accurate.",

      page4: "According to legend, when a blood eagle is performed on a fellow Viking, if the victim proceeds to scream in pain, they will not be permitted entry to Valhalla, and will be unable to join their families in the afterlife. This is definitely one of the most brutal ways to be executed, and would surely bring the most powerful Viking to surrender their place in Valhalla"

    valkyries:
    {
      welcome: "Welcome to my Valkyries story! If you ever see them, Valhalla awaits!",

      page1: "Valkyries known in Norse mythology as Choosers of the Slain. They were female spirits who served the god Odin and were sent by him to the battlefields to choose the slain who were worthy of a place in Valhalla, Odin's great hall in Asgard! During battles the Valkyries carried out Odin's commands, bringing either victory or defeat according to his wishes. After leading slain warriors to Valhalla, the Valkyries waited on them, serving them food and drink.",

      page2: "These foreboders of war rode to the battlefield on horses, wearing helmets and shields; in some accounts, they flew through the air and sea. Some Valkyries had the power to cause the death of the warriors they did not favour; others, especially heroine Valkyries, guarded the lives and ships of those dear to them.",

      page3: "Old Norse literature made references to purely supernatural Valkyries and also to human Valkyries with certain supernatural powers. Both types of beings were associated with fairness, brightness, and gold, as well as bloodshed.",

      page4: "In several myths, the Valkyries appeared as giant beings with supernatural powers who could cause a rain of blood to fall upon the land or row ships across the sky on rivers of blood. Some Valkyries caused warriors to die, while others served as protectors, guarding the lives of those most dear to them. Valkyries were often shown as wives of heroes. Brunhilde, one of the most famous Valkyries in mythology, disobeyed Odin and was placed in an enchanted sleep within a wall of fire as punishment."
